I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble formatting the table. Based on your message, it seems like the second last line is causing the table to be distorted. One way to fix this issue is to add a backslash (`\`) at the end of the second last line. This will tell Markdown to ignore the newline character and treat the two lines as a single line. Here's the corrected table:

| Variable      | Default Value          | Comments                   |
| ------------- |:----------------------:|:---------------------------|
| rgname | hci-demo | Name of Resource Group |
| rglocation | East US | Location of Resource Group |
| storageaccname | kcnsrarcsa | Name of Storage Account |
| storagecontname1 | sakcnsmonpoc016 | Name of Storage Container for storing python zip package |
| storagecontname2 | sakcnsmonpoc017 | Name of Storage Container for storing input json file |
| zipfl | createaksalertrules.zip | Name of python zip package |
| jsnfl | aksfuncattributes.json | Name of input json file |
| serviceplanname | kcns-arc-mmappsp-vmalert-001 | Name of app service plan |
| appinsightname | appi-arc-kcns-basemm-dev-001 | Name of app insight plan |
| kvname | kcnsarckv | Name of keyvault where secrets are stored |
| kvrgname | hci-demo | Name of Keyvault resource group |
| uaminame | uaminame | Name of User assigned managed identity |
| uamiresourcegroup | hci-demo | Resource group of User assigned managed identity |
| funcappname | kcns-arc-fapp | Name of Function App |
| agid |/subscriptions/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx/providers/microsoft.insights/actionGroups/metric-alert-ag  | ID of metric alert action group |
| tags | {} | Tag values |

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions..
